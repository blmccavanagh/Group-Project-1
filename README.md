## Description 
My Mind Matters was our first group project. So we created an app around mental health and with the goal for mental health assistance. 

We started out with a user story map:

But then we simplified the idea:

## Technologies used:

We used a number of different technologies in this project. we used a new framework Tail <br> 
https://tailwindcss.com/ 
<br>
it was very easy and simple to use. and it was interesting using a framework over writing all our own css. <br>
We also used a couple of different apis. One being checkbox survey api 
<br> 
https://www.checkbox.com/ 
<br> 
Now checkbox's interface was great and simple to use too. But after completing the questionnaire it gave us a JSON file to embed. it took us many days of trial and error to work out how to embed this file. there were a lot of resources but we struggled to get any methods we found to work. We've learn how difficult it can be using a new file format were not use to but, We were rather stubborn and got it to work in the end. 
<br> 
we also used the Google Maps Embed API 
<br>
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started 
<br>
This api was very easy to use it even had a map generator page: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/map-generator#testing_your_iframe

<br>

And we worked out just my entering location and gp near me it worked with our current location it seemd abit buggy sometimes it would show my location sometimes it would show close to my location so we want to research this abit more and make it more accurate.

## site preview

At this time due to time restraints the maps feature is on the home page which we are now thinking might be a better place for it anyway. 
<br>

<br>
NOTE: the bar at the top is animated. we thought have an animated gradient line would be calming and with our research found most metal health sites had some form of a rainbow colour scheme on there lading pages.

<br>
and we also made a logo(mockup) for our page and favicon.

<br>
The here! button on the home page then takes you to the k10 quiz we put together modeled after the k10 quiz medical professionals use.
<br>

![](assets/READ-ME-screenshots/k10-01.png)
<p> the quiz is multiple choice </p>

![](assets/READ-ME-screenshots/k10-02.png)
<p> and at the end the user will receive there result which they can print out and take to there gp.</p>

## future plans: 

<p>We plan to add an advanced search option At present, the map we have on our homepage automatically gives the user directions to their local GP based on their current location. We plan to advance this by letting the user search for the type of health professional they are specifically looking for, be it GP, psychologist or otherwise, and to choose the location they want to search for this help.</p> 
<p>we plan on adding forums for all users to talk about their experiences. and hopefully help one ad other maybe even form a community. </p>
<p>We also want to create some form of a custom mental health plan that the app can develope and the user can update with updates and reminders from the app itself </p>
